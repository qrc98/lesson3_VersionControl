            <p class="lead">In lesson 3 this week we learned about version control and it’s important to developing web application to programmers. Essentially, how it works is that there is one main repository where all of the files for a project is located and as the website needs to be updated or changes need to be made team members can check the files out from the repository modify them and commit them back into the repository. This is an effective way of modifying websites because as changes are being made the website can still be accessed and is not taken down at any point and once files are committed to the repository the website is updated according to the changes made. Solves problems with file sharing.</p>

            <p class="lead">In lesson 3 we learned about Version Control Systems whose role is to note who changed the files and keep track of the revision history, the date files were changed, the actual changes of the files (what’s new or different) and is responsible for merging the changes into the same file. There are certain advantages to using Version Control Systems, people can work on the same files simultaneously, can revert back to an older version of a file, and can backup files so developers won’t ever lose their work and have to start over. Additionally, whenever a repository is established, developers can monitor their change history and can track their current status and previous versions of their program. An example of an important Version Control system would be gitHub.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In lesson 3 we learned about remote and local repositories however for this section I would like to highlight remote repositories and its role in version control. Remote repositories are essential when it comes to sharing data with teammates, it basically a file server that developers can use to exchange and share data with other people. It’s also important to note that most of the actual work takes place in the local repository and all modifications and changes must be made and committed locally. Remote repositories come into play when you need to share or exchange your code with colleagues, this is not where you actually work on your files.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In lesson 3 we learned that about local and remote repositories and how they work and function with version control systems. Local repositories reside on a local computer or machine, in other words this is also where the work is done on an application. I’ve learned that there are two ways to create a local repository, one way is to create a brand-new repository or copy an existing remote repository onto your local device. You can use git commands to interact with the remote repository by pushing, pulling, and committing files onto to the remote repository via a local device. Developers should use version control systems because every user has a copy of the files that is stored locally on their machine.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In lesson 3 we learned that about local and remote repositories and how they work and function with version control systems. We also learned about git commands and how we can use them to interact with the remote repository and share files with other developers. Some examples of basic git commands would be, git init which creates a new Git repository, git add –all which will stage all files (this includes new and deleted files), git commit which is used to commit a snapshot of the staging directory to the commit history, git pull fetches and downloads content from a remote repository and updates the local repository to match it, and git push which uploads content from the local repositories to a remote repository. To share files from the local repository to the remote repository takes three basic steps, git add, git commit, and the git push.</p>
